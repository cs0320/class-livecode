# Playwright tests for the React NYT project

## How was Playwright installed here?

Following [the installation guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro):
* `mkdir playwright; cd playwright`
* `npm init playwright@latest`

## How do I run the Playwright tests?

To run tests: `npx playwright test`

To run tests in UI mode: `npx playwright test --ui`

## Where can I find example tests? 

In the `tests` subfolder. The one I wrote for this application is: `tests/app.spec.ts`.

### What's with ".spec"?

Different conventions. Playwright defaults to `spec` rather than `test` or `tests`.
