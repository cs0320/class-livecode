  //   (Tests that approximate user experience are better than ones that don't.)

  // You can use a "test ID" field if accessibility metadata isn't suitable.
  // Note React's strange prop name for this. We'd pass in the JSX: data-testid="test:header-text"
  await expect(page.getByTestId('test:header-text')).toBeVisible()

  // Last resort: use a locator to find by (say) class ID using a CSS selector:

/**
 * DEMO: getByRole (ARIA metadata)
 * https://playwright.dev/docs/locators#locate-by-role
 * 
 * Looking for our 3 input elements, these won't have visible text (yet). 
 * Instead, search for them based on ARIA (accessibility) annotations. 
 * 
 * To do this, we added aria-label values to these components in the React app. 
 * This might seem annoying, but: we've got 3 input boxes on the page. Shouldn't we 
 * provide some annotations to help (say) screenreaders disambiguate them without
 * relying on relative positioning?
