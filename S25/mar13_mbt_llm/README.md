# Livecode Vignette: Random Testing

* Part 1: using a reference implementation as an "oracle" for correctness. 
* Part 2: weaknesses of this approach, potential mitigations by...
  * becoming less specific (fuzzing); and
  * becoming more abstract (property-based testing). 
* Further Reading: mutating inputs in [_metamorphic_ testing](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/metamorphic-testing/); thanks to Hillel Wayne for the reference.
