# "Learn A Thing" For Fall 2024

I chose React Router as today's topic. I haven't really used it before myself, although we were considering it for this semester. I _thought_ I'd done a tutorial before, but I don't think I have; I was confusing it with a different library. 

React Router may be useful to some of you for your projects, but selfishly it will be useful for me over winter break! 

## The Rules 

I can't read docs in advance; I have to start from scratch. This is meant to be a live exercise in learning something new, although I try to pick something that:
* is probably going to be useful; and 
* I believe I can get to a minimum viable demo in an hour. 

## How I Started 

I've created an initial React application in this folder. We'll build on it. 

* Create the React TypeScript app with Vite: `npm create vite@latest app -- --template react-ts`
* `cd app`, `npm install`, and `npm run dev` to run the starter app.
* Note that the `README.md` file in the `app` directory is the auto-generated file produced by creating a new Vite project.   

## Notes while working 

I could run this as either a library or a framework; going for library for now because it looks simpler, but there are supposed advantages of using it as a framework (TODO: add link)
