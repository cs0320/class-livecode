# Java Concurrency Example 

This project contains more than the concurrency example from class and in the notes. It was originally used to demonstrate facades and proxies (aggregating iterators, etc.). There is also a demo of using thread pools to allow for parallelism. These won't be as useful now that 0320/1340 is entirely in TypeScript, but I'm leaving them in for reference.
